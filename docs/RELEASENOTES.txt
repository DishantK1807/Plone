Plone 4.0 - future
==================

The following is a list of important things to note when installing or
upgrading to Plone 4.0:

* Unpacking the Plone archive with WinZip will not work: WinZip will truncate
  filenames without warning you. 7-Zip is a good open source alternative for
  Windows that you can use instead: http://www.7-zip.org

* When using Python 2.4 the elementtree package is required. For Python 2.5
  and 2.6 the integrated xml.etree modules are used. Python 3 is not supported.

* Zope 2.12.0+ is now required. Older versions of Zope will not work. Zope
  2.13 and later may or may not work. Zope 3.x is not supported.

* Plone 4.0 only uses Python packages. Zope Products are no longer directly
  supported and need to be wrapped into the new package structure.


Important notes for users
-------------------------

Plone 4.0 adds new features to Plone 4 and is API incompatible in some ways.
Packages written for Plone 3.0 may need to be adjusted to work with Plone 4.0.
Plan in time for any upgrade and consider getting professional support.

A complete list of changes can be found online at
http://plone.org/products/plone/releases/4.0 . The most important changes are:

* Various packages which were so far distributed with the default installation
  now need to be installed separately. This includes wicked, AdvancedQuery
  and NuPlone.


Important notes for site and system administrators
--------------------------------------------------

For migration instructions please see the online Plone upgrade manual:

* In order to use the automatic indexing of Word and PDF files you will
  need to install some external tools: indexing of MS Word files requires
  the wvware product to be installed. For PDF files either the poppler
  suite is required.
