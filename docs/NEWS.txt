=========

3.3 - Unreleased
----------------

- "Mark external links" and "External links open in new window" were not working
  independently ('mark' had to be set for 'new window' to work) and marking could
  not be turned off at all (#7383). Fixed by having either one enable the js
  support and adding a new site property to control marking. Implemented so
  that new site property will be assumed false if missing and created on change
  if missing -- so no migration required. There is a matching change in 
  plone.app.controlpanel.
