Changelog
=========

4.0 - Unreleased
----------------

 - Hide the deprecation warning about the moved ITranslatable interface 
   for our own code. 
   [hannosch]

 - Use png icons instead of gif icons since they are much more flexible 
   for styling.
   [dannyb, wichert]

 - Fixed the coreVersions method in MigrationTool to return strings and not 
   bound methods for the Zope and Python version. 
   [hannosch]

 - Fixed off-by-two error in transaction_note. This closes 
   http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/7610
   [hannosch]

 - Moved all icons for real actions from the action icons tool to the
   actions themselves.
   [hannosch]

 - Changed PloneTool's getIconFor method to prefer the icon expression set 
   on the action itself instead of looking it up in the action icons tool. 
   This finally makes use of the new icon expression on actions introduced 
   in CMF 2.1. 
   [hannosch]

 - Avoid unneeded line breaks in TAL output, by effectively disabling the 
   internal beautified wrapping inside tags. This reduces the HTML output 
   by 5% - 10% for normal Plone pages. 
   [hannosch]

 - Memoize the installed products and packages in App.FactoryDispatcher 
   for the duration of the process runtime. 
   [hannosch]

 - Hiding page history, page navigation, and busy icon (spinner) in print.css 
   Related to http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/7433 
   http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/7402
   [siebo]

 - Updated webdav_enabled method in utils.py to check for 
   webdav.interfaces.IWriteLock interface in addition to the old Zope2 
   interface. 
   [hannosch]

 - Use a FauxArchetypeTool which returns no catalogs for CatalogMultiplex 
   aware objects in portal factory. This prevents most temporary objects 
   from being indexed in the first place. 
   [tesdal, hannosch]

 - Move our GenericSetup import step registrations to zcml. 
   [wichert]

 - Added a 'do-not-use' warning to the ZMI security screen for Plone content 
   objects. Sharing tab or workflows are what you are looking for. 
   [hannosch]

 - Moved interface declarations for factorytool from ZCML to the class. 
   [hannosch]

 - Added BBB code for ITranslatable, which is now part of LinguaPlone. 
   [hannosch]

 - Added an explicit button to add a new Plone site to the ZMI for faster 
   access. If you have installed Plone this is probably what you want to 
   add most of the time. The button only shows up in the root folder. 
   [hannosch]

 - Deprecate the ITranslatable interface. This interface is LinguaPlone- 
   specific and has thus been moved to LinguaPlone. 
   [wichert]

 - Removed tests for isRTL method of PTS. The method was deprecated in the 
   last release and is gone now. 
   [hannosch]

 - Use new contentless test class for all tests that don't depend on any. 
   [hannosch]

 - Replaced our FasterStringIO implementation by one based on 
   collections.deque, which is a faster than StringIO. 
   [hannosch]

 - Removed more deprecated code, adjusted some comments. 
   [hannosch]

 - Tweaked sortable_title method to give reasonable results for titles with 
   many numbers in them, like '1.2.3 document'. 
   [hannosch]

 - Moved CMF skins registration into configure.zcml, removed security 
   declaration for no-longer extant listPolicies of the portal. 
   [hannosch]

 - Refactored initial content creation into a separate extension profile, 
   thus making it possible to skip it. This refs 
   http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/6948 
   [hannosch]

 - Removed some outdated Extension scripts. 
   [hannosch]

 - Removed deprecated tool related Zope2 interfaces. Extended the 
   deprecation period for ConstrainTypes and NonStructuralFolder as these 
   are still used in Plone Core. 
   [hannosch]

 - Removed work-around code for insertion of non-unicode non-ascii non-utf8 
   encoded text in TAL. This will produce an error now. Always use Unicode 
   when using data in page templates and TAL. 
   [hannosch]

 - Removed lots of deprecated code and zcml registrations.
   [hannosch]
