Changelog
=========

4.0 - Unreleased
----------------

 - Removed dependency checking code for everything contained in the Plone 
   Core tarball. The number of dependencies is just too huge by now to 
   check them all. We still check external dependencies like Python, Zope, 
   PIL and elementree though.

 - Removed some outdated Extension scripts.

 - Removed deprecated tool related Zope2 interfaces. Extended the 
   deprecation period for ConstrainTypes and NonStructuralFolder as these 
   are still used in Plone Core.

 - Removed work-around code for insertion of non-unicode non-ascii non-utf8 
   encoded text in TAL. This will produce an error now. Always use Unicode 
   when using data in page templates and TAL.

 - Removed lots of deprecated code and zcml registrations.
