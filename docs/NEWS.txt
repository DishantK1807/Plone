Changelog
=========

4.0 - Unreleased
----------------

 - Made the fieldset tabbing code faster on startup (especially for IE) by 
   constructing a big string and creating the HTML elements in one bunch 
   instead of using DOM functions to add them step by step. 
   [fschulze]

 - Added uniqueItemIndex as a method to the plone view. 
   [hannosch]

 - Added dependency on plone.keyring and load its GS profile, so we get a 
   default KeyManager utility.
   [hannosch]

 - Added back ``global_defines.pt`` as a template including the (empty)
   macro definition. This allows main templates to be compatible with both 
   Plone 3.x and 4.0 at the same time. 
   [hannosch]

 - Removed ``global_defines.pt`` and the globalize-hack. Templates 
   now bring in their tool and function dependency using the 
   standard utility views or via normal Acquisition of tools.
   [malthe, hannosch]

 - Fixed test for editing language fields. This refs 
   http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/8342. 
   [hannosch]

 - Removed deprecated context parameter in getDefaultPage and 
   isDefaultPage in utils.py. 
   [maurits]

 - Made sure the export order of the factory tool GS step is consistent. 
   This closes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/7892. 
  [hannosch]

 - Replaced lock_icon with smaller version with one third of the size. 
   [hannosch]

 - Removed backwards-compatibility code in calendar_formfields.js introduced 
   in Plone 3.1.4. Any date-time picker not based on calendar_macros.pt 
   using the old-style (no plone.jscalendar namespace) methods will no 
   longer work until adjusted. 
   [mj]

 - Don't show relevance information of one percent in the search form,
   since sort_on searches will always show this for all entries
   This closes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/4325
   [hannosch]

 - Removed duplicated isMemberIdAllowed method from registration tool.
   [hannosch]

   http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/8219
   [hannosch]

   email address stored in their member data. This closes
   http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/5766
   [hannosch]

 - Avoid empty tags in the contact form. This closes
   http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/8182

 - Avoid an empty dd in recently modified.pt. This closes
   http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/8186
   [hannosch]

   http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/8181

   [hannosch]

 - Changed webstats_js in portal properties to a text field.
   This refs http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/7781
   [hannosch]

 - Added option to the error log control panel to search for an error log
   entry by number, since the number is the only thing that is exposed to
   normal users. This closes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/7234
   [hannosch]

 - Changed title of collections control panel to plural form. This
   closes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/8096
   [hannosch]

   inside the ZMI. This closes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/8075

   http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/8218

   the body text. This closes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/7952
   [hannosch]

   properties. This closes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/6005
   [hannosch]

 - Fixed invalid markup in membershipRolemapping.dtml. This closes 
   http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/6222
   [hannosch]

 - Removed long unused getObjPositionInParent.py script which wasn't 
   functional at all anymore, since it used Zope 2 interfaces. Also 
   simplified the getObjPositionInParent function in the CatalogTool. 
   This closes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/6081
   [hannosch]

 - Removed getActionObject call from createObject script. It was a private 
   method and would always fail. This closes 
   http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/7172
   [hannosch]

 - Removed testing of sendto action visibilty from sendto.cpy. There's a 
   permission to use to restrict sending mail. This closes 
   http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/5377
   [hannosch]

 - Disable external editor icon for structural folders. This closes 
   http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/6871
   [hannosch]

 - Updated the check_id script to disallowed content by the name of zip or 
   plone since this shadows the views by those names. This closes 
   http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/6105
   [hannosch]

 - Purged old Zope 2 Interface interfaces for Zope 2.12 compatibility. 
   [elro]

 - Make use of upgrade steps with a source '*' version and an explicit 
   destination, to register the 'enable site' and 'register tools as 
   utilities' only once.
   [hannosch]

 - Added support for upgrade step groups to the migration tool and started 
   exposing the individual upgrade methods as steps. 
   [hannosch]

 - Changed the way messages are handled during migration. We don't pass an 
   `out` list around anymore, but use the logging framework. 
   [hannosch]

 - Replaced our own migration step registration by using GenericSetup steps 
   directly. Changed the migration tool to integrate with GS instead. 
   Added BBB code to read the instance version from the migration tool if 
   the last profile version isn't set yet inside the GS tool. 
   [hannosch]

 - Exposed all our migration steps as GenericSetup upgrade steps.
   [hannosch]

 - Hide the deprecation warning about the moved ITranslatable interface 
   for our own code. 
   [hannosch]

 - Use png icons instead of gif icons since they are much more flexible 
   for styling.
   [dannyb, wichert]

 - Fixed the coreVersions method in MigrationTool to return strings and not 
   bound methods for the Zope and Python version. 
   [hannosch]

 - Fixed off-by-two error in transaction_note. This closes 
   http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/7610
   [hannosch]

 - Moved all icons for real actions from the action icons tool to the
   actions themselves.
   [hannosch]

 - Changed PloneTool's getIconFor method to prefer the icon expression set 
   on the action itself instead of looking it up in the action icons tool. 
   This finally makes use of the new icon expression on actions introduced 
   in CMF 2.1. 
   [hannosch]

 - Avoid unneeded line breaks in TAL output, by effectively disabling the 
   internal beautified wrapping inside tags. This reduces the HTML output 
   by 5% - 10% for normal Plone pages. 
   [hannosch]

 - Memoize the installed products and packages in App.FactoryDispatcher 
   for the duration of the process runtime. 
   [hannosch]

 - Hiding page history, page navigation, and busy icon (spinner) in print.css 
   Related to http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/7433 
   http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/7402
   [siebo]

 - Updated webdav_enabled method in utils.py to check for 
   webdav.interfaces.IWriteLock interface in addition to the old Zope2 
   interface. 
   [hannosch]

 - Use a FauxArchetypeTool which returns no catalogs for CatalogMultiplex 
   aware objects in portal factory. This prevents most temporary objects 
   from being indexed in the first place. 
   [tesdal, hannosch]

 - Move our GenericSetup import step registrations to zcml. 
   [wichert]

 - Added a 'do-not-use' warning to the ZMI security screen for Plone content 
   objects. Sharing tab or workflows are what you are looking for. 
   [hannosch]

 - Moved interface declarations for factorytool from ZCML to the class. 
   [hannosch]

 - Added BBB code for ITranslatable, which is now part of LinguaPlone. 
   [hannosch]

 - Added an explicit button to add a new Plone site to the ZMI for faster 
   access. If you have installed Plone this is probably what you want to 
   add most of the time. The button only shows up in the root folder. 
   [hannosch]

 - Deprecate the ITranslatable interface. This interface is LinguaPlone- 
   specific and has thus been moved to LinguaPlone. 
   [wichert]

 - Removed tests for isRTL method of PTS. The method was deprecated in the 
   last release and is gone now. 
   [hannosch]

 - Replaced our FasterStringIO implementation by one based on 
   collections.deque, which is a faster than StringIO. 
   [hannosch]

 - Removed more deprecated code, adjusted some comments. 
   [hannosch]

 - Tweaked sortable_title method to give reasonable results for titles with 
   many numbers in them, like '1.2.3 document'. 
   [hannosch]

 - Moved CMF skins registration into configure.zcml, removed security 
   declaration for no-longer extant listPolicies of the portal. 
   [hannosch]

 - Refactored initial content creation into a separate extension profile, 
   thus making it possible to skip it. This refs 
   http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/6948 
   [hannosch]

 - Removed some outdated Extension scripts. 
   [hannosch]

 - Removed deprecated tool related Zope2 interfaces. Extended the 
   deprecation period for ConstrainTypes and NonStructuralFolder as these 
   are still used in Plone Core. 
   [hannosch]

 - Removed work-around code for insertion of non-unicode non-ascii non-utf8 
   encoded text in TAL. This will produce an error now. Always use Unicode 
   when using data in page templates and TAL. 
   [hannosch]

 - Removed lots of deprecated code and zcml registrations.
   [hannosch]
