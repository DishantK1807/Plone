Changelog
=========

4.0 - Unreleased
----------------

 - Move our GenericSetup import step registrations to zcml. 
   [wichert]

 - Added a 'do-not-use' warning to the ZMI security screen for Plone content 
   objects. Sharing tab or workflows are what you are looking for. 
   [hannosch]

 - Moved interface declarations for factorytool from ZCML to the class. 
   [hannosch]

 - Added BBB code for ITranslatable, which is now part of LinguaPlone. 
   [hannosch]

 - Added an explicit button to add a new Plone site to the ZMI for faster 
   access. If you have installed Plone this is probably what you want to 
   add most of the time. The button only shows up in the root folder. 
   [hannosch]

 - Deprecate the ITranslatable interface. This interface is LinguaPlone- 
   specific and has thus been moved to LinguaPlone. 
   [wichert]

 - Removed tests for isRTL method of PTS. The method was deprecated in the 
   last release and is gone now. 
   [hannosch]

 - Use new contentless test class for all tests that don't depend on any. 
   [hannosch]

 - Replaced our FasterStringIO implementation by one based on 
   collections.deque, which is a faster than StringIO. 
   [hannosch]

 - Removed more deprecated code, adjusted some comments. 
   [hannosch]

 - Tweaked sortable_title method to give reasonable results for titles with 
   many numbers in them, like '1.2.3 document'. 
   [hannosch]

 - Moved CMF skins registration into configure.zcml, removed security 
   declaration for no-longer extant listPolicies of the portal. 
   [hannosch]

 - Refactored initial content creation into a separate extension profile, 
   thus making it possible to skip it. This refs 
   http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/6948 
   [hannosch]

 - Removed some outdated Extension scripts. 
   [hannosch]

 - Removed deprecated tool related Zope2 interfaces. Extended the 
   deprecation period for ConstrainTypes and NonStructuralFolder as these 
   are still used in Plone Core. 
   [hannosch]

 - Removed work-around code for insertion of non-unicode non-ascii non-utf8 
   encoded text in TAL. This will produce an error now. Always use Unicode 
   when using data in page templates and TAL. 
   [hannosch]

 - Removed lots of deprecated code and zcml registrations.
